# Don't worry about these for now. EDITS will define a larger set to capture
# other attributes of entire data sets.
classifiers:
- "Kind :: Model input"

- "Availability :: Collaborators only"

# List of data dimensions
dimension:
  time:
    scope: 2015-2050
    resolution: 5-year step
    description: Five year steps from 2015 to 2050 assumed to go from January 1st to December 31st.
  space:
    scope: global
    resolution: 19 world regions [market], 187 countries [countr_code], 8971 macro Functional Urban Areas [city_name]
    description: >-
      Markets defined at the ITF to keep homogenous socioeconomic and transport country caracteristics.
      Countries as defined by ISO3 codes.
      Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) defined bye the OECD-European Commission Cities in the World project, aggregated and completed with UN World Urbanization Prospects cities over 300 000 inhabitants when missing.
  transport modes:
    scope: 18 transport modes
    resolution: walk, bike, motorcycle, car, taxi, rail, metro, lrt, bus, brt, informal bus, three wheeler, scooter sharing, bike sharing, ride sharing, motorcycle sharing, car sharing, taxibus
    description: >-
      Transport modes
  population:
    scope: 10 population categories
    resolution: 2 gender categories, 5 age categories
    desription: >-
      The 10 population categories are a combination of the 2 gender categories (female - 0 and male - 1), and 5 age categories (0-19, 20-34, 35-54, 55-69, 70+)
  trip distance:
    scope: 6 distance categories
    resolution: under 1km, 1-2.5km, 2.5-5km, 5-10km, 10-20km, over 20km
    desription: >-
      The 6 trip distance categories are each eassigned an average trip distance and the availability of a mode can be adjusted to it.
  trip type:
    scope: 2 trip categories
    resolution: resident, tourist
    desription: >-
      Resident trips are trips made by people living in the urban area, while tourist trips are trips made by people visiting the urban area, and not living in it.

# List of data measures
measure:
  passenger travel demand:
    description: >-
      Resident and tourist passenger  transport  activity,  systematized  as  the  total  dis-tance  travelled  by  all  people  from  a functionnal urban area, by trip distance category (6), by mode(18), by age category (5), by gender(2), in the city centre vs the suburbs.
    unit of measurement: passenger-kilometre
    dimensions: time, space, trip distance, transport mode, population, trip type
 

# List of phenomenons represented in the model
phenomenon:
  shared mobility:
    description: >-
      Penetration of services that explore the shared use of resources (e.g. vehicles) or services (e.g. ride) to increase the efficiency of mobility provision. This increase in efficiency can be dual in reducing the holding of stock resources of mobility underused (e.g. cars) or in improving the efficiency of the resources when travelling (e.g. share rides and increase load factors). The concept explores the spectrum between private and public transport in terms of service provision and environmental and operational efficiency.
    quantity: passenger travel demand, vehicle travel demand, vehicle fleet
