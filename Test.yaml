dimension:
  time:
    scope: 2015-2050
    resolution: 5-year step
    description: Five year steps from 2015 to 2050 assumed to go from January 1st to December 31st.
  space:
    scope: global
    resolution: 19 world regions [market], 187 countries [countr_code], 8971 macro Functional Urban Areas [city_name]
    description: >-
      Markets defined at the ITF to keep homogenous socioeconomic and transport country caracteristics.
      Countries as defined by ISO3 codes.
      Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) defined bye the OECD-European Commission Cities in the World project, aggregated and completed with UN World Urbanization Prospects cities over 300 000 inhabitants when missing.
  transport modes:
    scope: 18 transport modes
    resolution: walk, bike, motorcycle, car, taxi, rail, metro, lrt, bus, brt, informal bus, three wheeler, scooter sharing, bike sharing, ride sharing, motorcycle sharing, car sharing, taxibus
    description: >-
      Transport modes
  population:
    scope: 10 population categories
    resolution: 2 gender categories, 5 age categories
    desription: >-
      The 10 population categories are a combination of the 2 gender categories (female - 0 and male - 1), and 5 age categories (0-19, 20-34, 35-54, 55-69, 70+)
  trip distance:
    scope: 6 distance categories
    resolution: under 1km, 1-2.5km, 2.5-5km, 5-10km, 10-20km, over 20km
    desription: >-
      The 6 trip distance categories are each eassigned an average trip distance and the availability of a mode can be adjusted to it.

measure:
  material production:
    description: >-
      Material mass produced in a certain country and year.
  end-use split:
    description: >-
      A ratio/transfer coefficient that determines which share of material production ends up in a certain end-use.
  average lifetime:
    description: >-
      The average lifetime of a certain end-use (product group) depicting the average time which a material stays in use.
      Can be used in different probability distributions to model the probability of materials flowing out of use.
